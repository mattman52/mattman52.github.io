This project is a web app. It is an information website about diabetes. There are **two interfaces** child and parent side.

- The login form. *Which does not need a password*

The child page contains:
- A **Home** page of what to find in the web app. 
- A **Basic** page of the basics of what Type 1 diabetes is

**All of these pages have sources that we used on the bottom of each page. The *Home* page has sources on the tools we used to build the website and the websites we got help from**


### Tools used in this project:
We used [BootStrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for styling, formating, and overall design of the web app
We also used basic website development languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

We chose these tools as they are the easiest for a project like this and they full filled all the requirments we needed

### Were you might get stuck
The login page has no password. You can either click submit or enter something in the password box then hit submit.

To get back to the Interface Selection screen click the T1DTutor at the top left of the screen.
