### What to expect in this project
This project is a web app. It is an information website about diabetes. There are **two interfaces**: a child and parent side.

Interface screen contains:
- The choice of selecting either parent or child side of the web app
- The login form. *Which does not need a password*

The child page contains:
- A **Home** page of what to find in the web app. 
- A **Basics** page of the basics of what Type 1 diabetes is
- An **Eating** page of healthy eating habits for people with diabetes
- An **Exercise** page of how to exercise safetly with Type 1 diabetes
- A **Glucose Monitor** page for where children can log if they have checked their glucose levels

The parent page contains:
- A **Home** page of what to find in the web app. 
- A **Basics** page of the basics of what Type 1 diabetes is
- A **School** page of how to help your child prepare for school
- A **Grocery** page of what kind of shopping you should do for a child that has Type 1
- A **Doctor** page that has the link to IUHealth telecommunication services and future home to the EMR system 
- An **Alert** page of where the parent can track their child's glucose logging

**All of these pages have sources that we used on the bottom of each page. The *Home* page has sources on the tools we used to build the website and the websites we got help from**

### Future roadmap
- The ability for users to create accounts and customize what they want on the account. Ex.. when their child should check glucose levels
- The ability for users to recieve push notifications for when they should check glucose levels. This will be a feature on the app
- Building out a full app that integrates everything the web app has but in an easy to use app
- Data collection on when the user logs their glucose time and if they opt in the ability to log the glucose levels and how much insulin they took
- An Emr system that integrates IUHealths telecommunication seemlessly
- Ability to connect to bluetooth pumps and other gadgets so users can track their glucose levels easily without inputing any data
- Adding more resources and information to strengthen out education section of the web app and app 


### Tools used in this project:
We used [BootStrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for styling, formating, and overall design of the web app
We also used basic website development languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

We chose these tools as they are the easiest for a project like this and they full filled all the requirments we needed

### Where you might get stuck
The login page has no password. You can either click submit or enter something in the password box then hit submit.

To get back to the Interface Selection screen click the T1DTutor at the top left of the screen.
